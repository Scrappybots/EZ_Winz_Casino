## Architecture Changes

### Before (SQLite)

│  ┌───────┐  │
│  │SQLite │  │ ← File-based, single-container storage

```

## Benefits

### Scalability
- ✅ Application pods are now stateless
- ✅ Can scale horizontally (multiple replicas)
- ✅ No file locking issues with concurrent access

### Performance
- ✅ Better query optimization
- ✅ Connection pooling support
- ✅ Index support for faster lookups
- ✅ Better handling of concurrent transactions

### Production Readiness
- ✅ ACID compliance with proper transaction isolation
- ✅ Better backup and restore capabilities
- ✅ Point-in-time recovery support
- ✅ Replication support (for HA setups)
- ✅ Better monitoring and diagnostics

### Operational Excellence
- ✅ Separate database and application concerns
- ✅ Independent scaling of database and application
- ✅ Standard PostgreSQL tooling and ecosystem
- ✅ Better integration with cloud services

## Backward Compatibility

### Configuration
- Database URL is now configured via environment variable
- Old SQLite code is fully compatible with SQLAlchemy PostgreSQL backend
- No application code changes required (thanks to SQLAlchemy ORM)

### Data Migration
- For existing SQLite databases, see migration steps in `POSTGRESQL_MIGRATION.md`
- SQLite dump can be converted to PostgreSQL format
- System accounts are recreated automatically on initialization

## Testing Checklist

### Local Development (Docker Compose)
- ✅ Container builds successfully
- ✅ PostgreSQL starts and passes health checks
- ✅ Application connects to database
- ✅ Database initialization creates system accounts
- ✅ API endpoints work correctly
- ✅ Frontend can connect to backend
- ✅ Transactions are persisted
- ✅ Casino games function properly

### Kubernetes Deployment
- ✅ All YAML manifests are valid
- ✅ Namespace creates successfully
- ✅ Secrets and ConfigMaps apply correctly
- ✅ PostgreSQL deployment starts
- ✅ PVC binds to storage
- ✅ PostgreSQL passes readiness probes
- ✅ Database initialization job completes
- ✅ Application pods start successfully
- ✅ Application passes health checks
- ✅ Service exposes application correctly
- ✅ Ingress routes traffic properly (if configured)
- ✅ Database persists data across pod restarts
- ✅ Application scales horizontally

## Security Improvements

### Secrets Management
- ✅ Database passwords in Kubernetes Secrets (not ConfigMaps)
- ✅ Connection strings with credentials in Secrets
- ✅ Template file prevents accidental secret commits

### Network Security
- ✅ PostgreSQL not exposed externally by default (ClusterIP)
- ✅ Application connects via internal service DNS
- ✅ Can add NetworkPolicies for additional isolation

### Access Control
- ✅ Dedicated database user (not postgres superuser)
- ✅ Database password required (no trust authentication)
- ✅ Per-database access (neobank user can't access other DBs)

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Metrics to Track
- Database connection count
- Query performance (slow query log)
- Database size and growth rate
- Cache hit ratio
- Transaction throughput
- Application response times
- Error rates

### Health Checks
- PostgreSQL readiness probe (`pg_isready`)
- Application health endpoint (`/health`)
- Database connectivity from application

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### High Availability
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL replication (primary + replica)
- [ ] Set up automatic failover with Patroni
- [ ] Use StatefulSet for PostgreSQL (instead of Deployment)

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Automated daily backups (pg_dump)
- [ ] Backup retention policy (7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly)
- [ ] Test restore procedures regularly
- [ ] Consider point-in-time recovery (PITR) with WAL archiving

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL parameters for workload
- [ ] Implement read replicas for scaling reads
- [ ] Add pgBouncer for connection pooling
- [ ] Enable query performance monitoring (pg_stat_statements)

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Enable TLS for PostgreSQL connections
- [ ] Rotate database passwords regularly
- [ ] Implement network policies
- [ ] Set up audit logging

### Observability
- [ ] Integrate with Prometheus for metrics
- [ ] Set up Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Configure alerts for critical metrics
- [ ] Centralized logging with ELK/Loki
