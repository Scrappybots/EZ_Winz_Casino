# 🎰 Free Spins Feature Update

## Overview
The Starlight Smuggler slot machine now properly handles free spins! When you trigger 3+ scatter symbols (🌀), you receive 5 free spins that are stored and consumed on subsequent spins.

## How It Works

### Previous Behavior
- Free spins were processed immediately with 1-second delays between each spin
- This caused long wait times and the player couldn't see each individual spin result

### New Behavior
1. **Trigger Free Spins**: Get 3+ scatter symbols (🌀) on a paid spin
2. **Store Free Spins**: You receive 5 free spins added to your account
3. **Use Free Spins**: Press the spin button to use one free spin at a time
4. **No Charge**: Free spins don't deduct from your balance
5. **Win Collection**: Any winnings are still credited to your account

## Key Features

### For Players
- ✨ **Visual Feedback**: See a glowing banner when you have free spins available
- 🆓 **Free Spin Button**: Button changes to "FREE SPIN!" when you have spins available
- 📊 **Spin Counter**: Always see how many free spins you have remaining
- 💰 **Win Tracking**: Each free spin's results are shown individually
- 🎉 **Better Experience**: Feel the excitement of each free spin

### Technical Details

#### Database Changes
- Added `free_spins` column to `users` table
- Default value: 0
- Type: Integer (non-nullable)

#### Backend Changes (`casino.py`)
- Modified `spin_starlight_smuggler()` function
- Checks if player has free spins before charging
- Awards free spins when scatter symbols appear (only on paid spins)
- Decrements free spin count when used
- Returns `free_spins_remaining`, `was_free_spin`, and `bonus_spins_awarded` in response

#### Frontend Changes

**HTML (`index.html`)**:
- Added free spins banner that pulses when active
- Updated button text to show "FREE SPIN!" when available
- Added "FREE SPIN USED!" notice in results
- Modified bet display to show "FREE SPIN!" instead of cost

**JavaScript (`app.js`)**:
- Updates `user.free_spins` from API response
- Shows toast notifications for free spin events
- Tracks free spin usage

**CSS (`cyberpunk.css`)**:
- Added `.free-spins-banner` with pulsing animation
- Added `.free-spin-notice` styling

## Game Rules

### Free Spin Awarding
- ✅ 3+ scatter symbols (🌀) on any paid spin = 5 free spins
- ❌ Scatter symbols during free spins do NOT award additional free spins
- ✅ All other winning combinations pay normally during free spins

### Free Spin Usage
- Free spins are used automatically when you press the spin button
- You can still adjust your bet amount (it's ignored during free spins)
- One free spin is consumed per button press
- Winnings are calculated using the bet amount from when you triggered the bonus

## Testing

To test the free spins feature:

1. **Login** to the application (or register a new account)
2. **Navigate** to the Casino view
3. **Select** Starlight Smuggler game
4. **Set your bet** (recommended: ¤5 per line)
5. **Spin** until you get 3+ scatter symbols (🌀)
6. **Watch** for the "5 FREE SPINS AWARDED!" message
7. **See** the pulsing banner showing your free spins
8. **Press SPIN** to use each free spin one at a time
9. **Enjoy** collecting your winnings!

## Database Migration

If you already have an existing database, the application automatically creates the `free_spins` column on startup. If you're starting fresh, the column is included in the initial schema.

### Manual Migration (if needed)
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN free_spins INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
```

## API Response Format

### New Fields in `/api/v1/casino/starlight-smuggler/spin`

```json
{
  "grid": [...],
  "bet_per_line": 5.0,
  "total_bet": 0,  // 0 when using free spin
  "win_multiplier": 30,
  "win_amount": 150.0,
  "winning_lines": [0, 1, 2],
  "scatter_count": 3,
  "bonus_spins_awarded": 5,  // New: how many free spins were just awarded
  "free_spins_remaining": 4,  // New: total free spins left after this spin
  "was_free_spin": true,      // New: indicates if this was a free spin
  "balance": 1150.0
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Player Experience**: Players can see and appreciate each individual free spin
2. **More Excitement**: The anticipation builds with each spin button press
3. **Clearer Feedback**: Visual indicators show when free spins are active
4. **Fair Play**: Free spins don't charge the player
5. **Persistent**: Free spins are saved to the database (persist across sessions)

## Notes

- Free spins can only be triggered on **paid spins** (not during other free spins)
- Free spins are **player-specific** and stored in their account
- The feature works **cross-session** - log out and back in, your free spins are still there
- **No expiration** - free spins don't expire

## Future Enhancements

Possible future additions:
- Free spin multipliers (2x wins during free spins)
- Retriggering (allow scatter symbols during free spins to award more)
- Different free spin amounts (3 scatters = 5 spins, 4 scatters = 10 spins, etc.)
- Sound effects for free spin triggers
- Animation sequences for bonus rounds
